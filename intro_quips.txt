, it is good to meet you.
I am Reiner.
...
Reiner: I must say, You caught me at a rather stressful time.
Reiner: I am on my way back from a week's journey at sea!
*He is carrying a large sack of what appears to be fish, over his shoulder*
Reiner: Rough weather coming in let me tell you.
Reiner: I see that you are without supplies, you must be hungry!
Reiner: Come with me, you don't want to be out here with night approaching!
*You went with Reiner to rest at his house*
Reiner: So, now that I know you aren't a pirate,
Reiner: I can tell you about the treasure deep in the forrest!
Reiner: The local towns around the area have been ravaged by the pirates.
Reiner: The Pirates are notoriously evil and steal all that they can.
Reiner: The Pirates hid their treasure deep within the forrest at a secret location.
Reiner: If you come with me and help me find the treasure, we can split it 50/50?
Oh no! you lost too much health and died!
Game Over :(
Reiner: It seems that you have beaten me at my own game.
*Reiner begins to head towards his sack*
Reiner: You beat me, here you go.
*Reiner handed you the sack*
Reiner: That is the treasure I told you about.
Reiner: I was the pirate in charge of burying the treasure that I told you about.
Reiner: Congratgulations, Kid.
Game Over, you Won!
